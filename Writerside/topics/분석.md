## Setting up analyses

To start a new analysis in Sparrow Cloud, you need to set up a **Source repository** or **Web page to analyse** in your **Project**. The **Source code repository** refers to the repository you created with your GitHub account and points to the specific repository you have set up in your project. When you perform an analysis, all files contained in that repository will be analysed. The **Web page to analyse** is a web page in the form of a URL that is accessible over the internet and is set by you. When you perform an analysis, you can analyse 1) the subpages that you can navigate to from that URL, and 2) the pages that you set as analysis options.


1. Sign in to **Sparrow Cloud**, then click the project you want to analyse.
2. Click the **Modify Project** button.

### Set up a source code repository

3. If you are not GitHub authenticated, click the **GitHub authentication** button in the **Source repository** and sign in to GitHub.
4. If you have registered an account with GitHub or have already authenticated, click the **Select a GitHub repository** button.
5. Select the repository you want to analyse from the slides.
6. Click the **Modify** button on the project information slide.


You have now set up your **Source code repository**, where files stored in the selected repository will be used for **Source code** and **Open source** analyses.

### Setting up web pages to analyse

7. Click the **Set web page** button on the **Modify project** slide.
8. In **URL**, enter the address of the web page you want to analyse and click the **Test Connection** button to verify the connection.
> **Tip**: The URL must be entered in URL format starting with `http://`.
9. Adjust the **Analysis Options** if necessary and click the **Setup** button.
> **Tip**: Users can adjust the web vulnerability analysis options to determine which web pages will be analysed and to what extent. For a detailed description of **Analysis Options**, see [here](http://localhost:63342/newCloud/preview/empty-md-topic.html#-k39vs6_6035).
10. Download the **key file** and save it to the web page you want to analyse, see [Saving a key file](http://localhost:63342/newCloud/preview/%EB%B6%84%EC%84%9D.html#-iwingv_14386).
11. Click the **Modify** button on the project information slide.



#### Saving the key file

**The key file is a file generated by Sparrow Cloud that targets the web page URL you set up in your project. We require users to save the key file to ensure that they own the web page they set up. If a user accidentally sets an unrelated web page to be analysed, the analysis will not start without the key file.
Here's how to save a key file

1. First, you need to set up analysable web pages in your project. See [Setting up web pages to analyse] (http://localhost:63342/Cloud_Guide/preview/%EB%B6%84%EC%84%9D.html#-ct0ecv_4138) above.
2. Click the **Download key file** button on the target URL in the **Modify your project** slide.
3. Navigate to the **root directory** of the server running the web page in a CMD window or file explorer.
4. Save the downloaded **key file**.

> **Tip**: The **root directory** is usually the top-level folder where the program you want to analyse is stored.


## To analyse


1. Click the **Start New Task** button.
2. Select a **storage location** to start analysing **Source code and components**.
3. Select a **URL** to start analysing **Web Vulnerabilities**.
4. The analysis will now start.
