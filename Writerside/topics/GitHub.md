# GitHub Repository

Sparrow Cloud connects to your GitHub repository, pulls in uploaded files, and uses them for source code and component analysis. As mentioned in the previous guide, it is mandatory to create and authenticate a GitHub account in order to perform this analysis.
Please note that not all GitHub repositories are available to connect to Sparrow Cloud, depending on which plan you are on. Also, the repositories available depend on where you have installed the GitHub App, as follows

## GitHub App installation location

- If you installed the GitHub app on a personal account,
  - That account's public and private repositories.
  - Repositories that you forked from that account.
- If you installed the GitHub app in an organisation,
  - Your personal account's public repository.
  - Your organisation's public and private repositories.
  - The repository you forked from your organisation.
