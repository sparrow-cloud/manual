# GitHub Repository

Sparrow Cloud connects to your GitHub repository, pulls in uploaded files, and uses them for source code and component analysis. As mentioned in the previous guide, it is mandatory to create and authenticate a GitHub account in order to perform this analysis.
Please note that not all GitHub repositories are available to connect to Sparrow Cloud, depending on which plan you are on. Also, the repositories available depend on where you have installed the GitHub App, as follows
