# Asset

## Asset identifier

A unique string used to identify an asset, usually represented as the path or URL to the asset. If two assets within the same project have the same identifier, they are marked as the same asset.

When displaying **file** assets, the assets are displayed as relative paths, excluding the name of the repository selected for analysis.


## Asset tree

After a user runs an analysis, the asset tree is displayed on the left side of the project details page. Users can view assets in the tree, as well as see if an asset has an exclamation point icon to determine if issues have been detected on that particular asset. In addition, clicking on a specific asset in the asset tree displays a list of issues detected on that asset in the right frame.
