If you are a free user, you can still experience all three services, but with some restrictions. Paid users get enhanced services in the following areas
- You are not limited to the number of analyses you can perform.
- The types of GitHub repositories that can be analysed are expanded to include private.
- You can see open source licences identified through component analysis.
- Web vulnerability analysis uses more rules and increases the depth of analysis.

> **Tip**: Even if you are a paid user, there may be differences in the types of repositories you can analyse depending on where you have installed the GitHub App. For more information, see [Where to install GitHub App](#installing-the-github-app-sparrow-cloud).
